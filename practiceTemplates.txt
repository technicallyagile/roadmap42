description:<p>In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitchhiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopaedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects.\nFirst, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words DON'T PANIC inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.</p>

description:<p>The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team. The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint. At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours. This optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting upcoming Sprint work. The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Development Team uses the Daily Scrum to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and to inspect how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog. The Daily Scrum optimizes the probability that the Development Team will meet the Sprint Goal. Every day, the Development Team should understand how it intends to work together as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment by the end of the Sprint.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The structure of the meeting is set by the Development Team and can be conducted in different ways if it focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal. Some Development Teams will use questions, some will be more discussion based. Here is an example of what might be used:</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Development Team or team members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for detailed discussions, or to adapt, or replan, the rest of the Sprint’s work.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Scrum Master ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Master teaches the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute time-box.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Daily Scrum is an internal meeting for the Development Team. If others are present, the Scrum Master ensures that they do not disrupt the meeting.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Daily Scrums improve communications, eliminate other meetings, identify impediments to development for removal, highlight and promote quick decision-making, and improve the Development Team’s level of knowledge. This is a key inspect and adapt meeting.</p>
